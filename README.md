# EXtensible Animator for Mobile Simulations (EXAMS)

EXAMS is a visualization tool for the wireless network simulator [NS-2](https://www.isi.edu/websites/nsnam/ns/).

- Built with the network protocol designer in mind.
- Enable accurate animation of NS-2 simulations with a synchronized visualization of the wireless transmission and the internal data structures stored in each node.
- Modular architecture allows custom protocol visualisations implemented as extensions to the main tool.
- Provide the environment to study, test and debug wireless networks.
